<h3>Hey there!</h3>

My name is Mihir. I am a software engineer with 4 years of experience building scalable, high-performance backend systems. I am currently pursuing my masters in Software Engineering at Purdue University. I am passionate about designing efficient and fault-tolerant system architectures. I am skilled in integrating LLMs into production environments, with hands-on experience in prompt engineering and GenAI implementation. I enjoy tackling complex problems, drive high-impact solutions, and lead projects that enhance system reliability, performance, and scalability. I love exploring tech and [hacking](https://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) together cool projects. I love Emacs!
